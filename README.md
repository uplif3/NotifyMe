#How does it work?`

Opens the Chrome Browser with the Chromedriver every 15 minutes and if there is a Buy link
it will send it to you so you can buy it on your Device.

You can probably turn the time down but you could get "shadowbanned" so that the bot cant crawl the information anymore. It took a few hours before the bot could get the data again.

Was able to grab a Card on the first restock after i started this bot.

Have fun.
